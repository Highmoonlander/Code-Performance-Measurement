#Code Performance Measurement

This Java program measures the process time and memory usage of a code block. It provides valuable insights into the performance of the code and helps identify potential areas for optimization and memory management.

How it Works
The program records the start time using System.currentTimeMillis() and the initial memory usage by subtracting the free memory from the total memory using Runtime.getRuntime().
The code block of interest should be placed in the designated section.
The program then records the end time and the final memory usage.
The process time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time, while the memory usage is determined by subtracting the initial memory usage from the final memory usage.
The results are printed to the console, displaying the process time in milliseconds and the memory usage in bytes.

Benefits
Performance Optimization: By measuring process time, you can identify bottlenecks and optimize critical sections of your code for better performance.
Memory Management: Monitoring memory usage helps detect potential memory leaks and allows for efficient memory allocation and deallocation.

Usage
Insert your code block in the designated section.
Compile and run the program.
Observe the process time and memory usage printed in the console.
Analyze the results to optimize your code and manage memory effectively.
Feel free to modify and integrate this code into your projects to gain valuable insights into code performance.
